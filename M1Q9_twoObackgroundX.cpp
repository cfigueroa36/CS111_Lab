/* Write a complete C++ program that does the following. (Programs that correctly carry out some
of the tasks will receive partial credit.)
1. It asks the user to enter an integer n that is between 1 and 21.
2. It repeatedly reads n from the user until the supplied value of n is legal.
3. It prints out a picture of an n Ã— n square formed of X characters except that a diagonal stripe, formed by the
diagonal and any position immediately to its right, is printed using an O character. */
